* So, Let's Go!

First, has _everyone_ installed Go?

*Agenda*

- Why Go?
- Workspace
- Basics of Go
- Quick overview of pointers vs by-value
- Coding example
- Homework

* Why go with Go?

.image ./images/pros.png

- Compiles to machine code (read: *Fast*!!)
- Platform agnostic
- Garbage collected
- Concurrency is first class citizen (*channels* are our friend)
- Built-in unit testing
- Documentation is part of the language
- Rich standard library
- Building executables are easy and faster

* Why not Go?

- A relatively young language, though not so much an issue anymore
- Does not have true OO
- Handling errors can be tedious, but required (maybe not a bad thing?)

* Workspace

Understanding a Go Workspace

- The `$GOPATH` environment points to the root folder for all of your Go projects
- Under that directory will be a `src` folder
- A project consists of the SCM `/` your name or organization `/` and the project name

    bitbucket.org/nordstrom/order-guard

    order-guard.go                      // The main package, which is run when the service starts up
    |
    |-- ðŸ“‚ webapi
            |
            |-- handlers.go         // Contains all of the API handlers for the web service
            |-- listener.go         // The listener for all of the incoming HTTP requests, acts as the main entry point for the start of the service
            |-- router.go           // Routs the HTTP requests to a specific handler
    |-- ðŸ“‚ service
            |
            |-- dispatcher.go       // Dispatches new work to an available worker from its pool of workers
            |-- return.go           // Lists the possible return values for the service
            |-- service.go          // The entry point for all API requests from the web

* Basics of Go

- Organized into packages
- A package name must match the folder name
- Each file in a package contains the package name, and has the extension `.go`
- Variables, structs and functions that have the first letter capitalized are exported

    var Foo int
    var boo string

- Executables have exactly one package called `main`
    package main

    func main() {
        // kick off some work

        // wait for it to finish

        // exit
    }

* Data Types

- The usual suspects:
    bool
    int, int8, int16, int32, int64
    uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64, uintptr
    byte // (unit8)
    rune // (int32)
    float32, float64
    complex64, complex128
    string
- Variable declarations begin with the variable name followed by the type:
    variableName    string
    anotherVariable int
    trueOrFalse     bool

* Data Structs & Functions

- Code predominantly consists of data structs and functions
- A struct is declared like so:

    type foo struct {
        firstName   string
        lastName    string
        addressOne  string
        amount      float32
        refCount    int
    }

- A function is declared like so, and can have multiple return values

    func fooBar(inputOne string, inputTwo []byte, randomFlag bool) (*foo, error) {
        // code goes here

        return foo, nil
    }

* Methods

- For most OO languages, a class definition includes methods
- in Go, which has limited OO, you have *receivers*

    func (service *Service) CalculateTotalOrderAmount() float32 {
    }

- Therefore, only a pointer to a struct called `Service` can call the function `CalculateTotalOrderAmount`

    service := &Service{
        orderLines []orderLine
    }

    total := service.CalculateTotalOrderAmount()

- Note the way the variables are assinged using `:=` as opposed to just `=`. This saves the step of declaring the variable first

* Error Handling

- Go has the concept of exceptions in the form of *panics*
- Panics should be used rarely, at best!
- Instead, functions should return errors, like so

    output, err := json.Marshal(myObject)
    if err != nil {
        log.Printf("an error occurred marshing the object: %v", err)
        return errors.New("This method failed because object marshaling failed")
    }

* First coding example

- A simple `main` function
    func main() {
        var verbose bool

        fmt.Print("**********************\n")
        fmt.Print("Welcome to an example!\n")
        fmt.Print("**********************\n\n")

        flag.BoolVar(&verbose, "verbose", false, "verbose flag")
        flag.Parse()
        fmt.Printf("The verbose flag was set to: %v\n", verbose)
    }

* Pass By-Reference vs By-value

- Pointers are faster
- With pointers, values can be modified within functions
- By-Value should be considered carefully for efficiency

* Quicksort walkthrough

So, what is Quicksort?

Now, it's time to Code!

* Assignment due next week

- Create a simple Go application that
    1. models a deck of cards (52 cards, 4 suits)
    2. prints out the cards in the deck
    3. shuffles the deck and prints out the new deck order
